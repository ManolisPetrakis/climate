This repository contains materials relevant to the analysis of climate model output datasets, specifically focusing on the investigation of wildfire emissions, aerosols, and trace gases.

My intention is to publish materials related to the results of my research, primarily in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. Some notebooks will be more extensive, designed to help newcomers adopt good programming practices and leverage the power of well-known and efficient libraries, such as `xarray`.
